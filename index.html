        <h2>The Scrum Guide Says...</h1>
        <p>
          The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
          Product Backlog management includes:
          Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
          <li>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
          <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
          <li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed;
        </ul>
